            I understand that Telehealth is a mode of delivering health care
            services via communication technologies (e.g., internet or
            cellphone) to facilitate diagnosis, consultation, treatment,
            education, care management, and self-management of a patientâ€™s
            health care.

              I understand that Junction and affiliate Openloop Healthcare
              Partners, PC offer Telehealth consultations, which are conducted
              through videoconferencing, telephonic, and asynchronous technology
              and my Telehealth provider will not be present in the room with
              me.

              understand that either my Telehealth provider or I can discontinue
              the Telehealth appointment if the technical connections are not
              adequate for my visit.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that I could seek an in-office visit rather than
              obtain care from a Telehealth provider, and I am choosing to
